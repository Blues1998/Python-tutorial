# Ask the user for a list input. The list could contain any number and/or type of elements. Once the user hits enter
# after entering all the elements of the list, let the user search for an element in the same list. If the element
# exists, return its position otherwise return a message saying the element doesn't exist


# Once this is done, also allow the user to delete an element of the list.
